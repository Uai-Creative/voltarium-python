**Modern, asynchronous Python client for the CCEE (Brazilian Electric Energy Commercialization Chamber) API.** Built with Python 3.13+ and designed for high-performance energy sector applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔥 Asynchronous**: Built with `httpx` and `asyncio` for maximum performance
- **🔒 Type Safe**: Complete type hints with Pydantic models for bulletproof code
- **🛡️ Robust**: Automatic OAuth2 token management with intelligent retry logic
- **🏗️ Real Staging Data**: 60+ authentic CCEE credentials for comprehensive testing
- **⚡ Modern**: Python 3.13+ with UV for lightning-fast dependency management
- **✅ Production Ready**: Comprehensive test suite and error handling

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Using UV (recommended)
uv add voltarium

# Using pip
pip install voltarium
```

## 🔥 Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from voltarium import VoltariumClient

async def main():
    async with VoltariumClient(
        client_id="your_client_id",
        client_secret="your_client_secret"
    ) as client:
        # List retailer migrations with automatic pagination
        migrations = client.list_migrations(
            initial_reference_month="2024-01",
            final_reference_month="2024-12",
            agent_code="12345",
            profile_code="67890"
        )

        # Stream results efficiently
        async for migration in migrations:
            print(f"Migration {migration.migration_id}: {migration.migration_status}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🏗️ Real Staging Environment

Test with **real CCEE data** using our comprehensive staging environment:

```python
from voltarium.sandbox import RETAILERS, UTILITIES
from voltarium import SANDBOX_BASE_URL

# Use real staging credentials
retailer = RETAILERS[0]  # 30+ available retailers
utility = UTILITIES[0]   # 30+ available utilities

# Test with actual CCEE staging API
async with VoltariumClient(
    base_url=SANDBOX_BASE_URL,
    client_id=retailer.client_id,
    client_secret=retailer.client_secret
) as client:
    # All operations work with real data
    migrations = await client.list_migrations(...)
```

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/joaodaher/voltarium-python.git
cd voltarium-python

# Install dependencies (requires UV)
task install-dev

# Run tests
task test

# Quality checks
task lint && task format && task typecheck
```

## 🎯 Current Status

**Alpha Release** - Core migration endpoints fully supported:

✅ **Retailer Migrations** - Complete CRUD operations, with V1/V1.1/V2 API version support (`api_version=`, defaults to `"v2"`)
✅ **Contracts** - List, get, create, and download signed contract files
✅ **Measurements** - List consumption measurements with automatic same-month chunking
✅ **Change Requests (Solicitações)** - Representative changes, return to captive market, supply suspension, and approve/reject workflow
🚧 **Utility Migrations** - Under development
📋 **Additional Endpoints** - [See roadmap](https://voltarium.github.io/voltarium-python/staging/#roadmap)

> **1.0.0 note:** `VoltariumClient`'s default `api_version` is now `"v2"` (previously the only
> option was CCEE's V1 migrations API). Pass `api_version="v1"` to keep the old behavior — see
> [API Versioning](docs/endpoints.md#api-versioning-migrations).
